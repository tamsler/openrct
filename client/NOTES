- JacORB version: JacORB1_4_beta2

- To run the client, execute:
  jaco -DORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc::192.168.1.10:3350/NameService Client

  You don't need to pass the ORBInitRef string if you adjust the
  jacorb.properties to match the above syntax.

- Building JacORB with Notification Service: (Information provided by: Nikolas xanith@web.de)
  In the <jacorbtop>/idl/build.xml file you got to add "notification" to some depend-targets.

  These are the critical lines:
  <!--
  top-level targets
  -->
  <target name="all" depends="corba,names,security,events,transactions,concurrency,collections,trading"/>
  <target name="services" depends="events,trading,collections,transactions,concurrency" />

  Then you got to add a #include directive to the CosNotifyFilter.idl. Add #include <orb.idl>

- Creat a jar archive for RCT
  First, create a softlink in "rct-unix-client-java/classes" called "org" pointing to <path to JacORB>/classes/org>
  Second, make sure that all the *.properties and the Manifest.mf file is in "rct-unix-client-java/classes"
  Now we can create the rct.jar file by executing:  

    jar cfm rct.jar Manifest.mf *.class RCT/*.* org/* edu/* *.properties
  
  Create a directory "rct_clt".  In that directory, create a sub-directory called "images". Then
  move the rct.jar file into the "rct_clt" directory. Also copy all the client GIFs and JPGs to
  the "rct_clt/images" directory.
  
  Now you can run the client within the "rct_clt" directory bye executing:
  
  java -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORB -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORBSingleton -jar rct.jar

  NOTE: You can create a script "rct.sh" or "rct.bat" containing the above execution command.

- If we don't have a orb.properties with JacORB entries, we can start the client with the following command:
  java -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORB -Dorg.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass=org.jacorb.orb.ORBSingleton -jar rct.jar

- Execute an application within java:
  try {
	Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("netscape www.yahoo.com");
	}
	catch (Exception e) {
	    e.printStackTrace();
	}
