You have to have a microphone at your workstation in order to record a sound message. When you are ready to 	  record a sound message, click on the &ldquo;Record&rdquo; button and start to speak your sound message. After you 	  have finished speaking your message, click on the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; button. Then you are prompted to give the just 	  recorded audio message a name. Once you accept the provided name, the recorded audio message is uploaded to the server 	  and all the session participants are notified about the recorded sound message. You will see an entry in the 	  &ldquo;Sound Files&rdquo; section. </p>      <p>To play a sound message, highlight an entry in the Sound Files list and then click on the Play button. This will 	  download the sound message from the server and once the download has finished, it will automatically start playing 	  the audio message. Once downloaded, you can replay it as many times as you wish.</p>	</td>  </tr></table></font></body></html>
