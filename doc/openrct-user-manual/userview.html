      <p>The User View shows all the users that are enrolled in the same classes 
	  and teams as the person who logs in. The users that are currently online are indicated by the word &ldquo;on-line&rdquo; next 
	  to the user icon. In addition, their name is set in a bold font. By double clicking on a user icon, the user information will 
	  expand and reveal all the classes the selected user is enrolled in. One can further double click on any of the user associated 
	  classes and all the teams and groups linked to that class in which the user is enrolled in will show up. </p>

	  To view more detailed user information, select a user icon and then click on the &ldquo;View User Info&rdquo;. This will open 
	  up a user information area on the right side in the &ldquo;User View&rdquo;. A user picture is shown, if it is available, as 
	  well as other specific user information.</p>
